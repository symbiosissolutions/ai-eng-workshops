## Introduction

The role of an AI Engineer is becoming increasingly essential as the capabilities of AI continue to expand. This emerging profession blends the principles of software engineering with the application of AI models, moving beyond traditional engineering. The demand for AI Engineers is projected to grow exponentially, fueled by the widespread adoption of AI across various industries. Unlike traditional Machine Learning roles, AI Engineers focus on applying existing models to solve real-world problems, often without the need for a deep research background.

In this workshop series, we delve into various topics of critical importance to AI Engineers. We dive into theories to support the understanding and application of knowledge in designing and developing AI solutions, ranging from simple to complex tools and techniques. The series includes demonstrations of code implementations, engaging activities, and sharing of key industry insights to train, motivate and support participants to pursue a career in AI.
