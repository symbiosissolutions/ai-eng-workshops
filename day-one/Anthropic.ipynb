            "\n",
            "2. Rinse the rice (optional):\n",
            "   - Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under running water, gently stirring the rice with your hand. This helps remove any excess starch.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Add water:\n",
            "   - Transfer the rinsed rice to a saucepan or pot. Add the appropriate amount of water. The water-to-rice ratio can vary depending on the type of rice, but a common ratio is 1 cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Bring to a boil:\n",
            "   - Place the saucepan or pot on the stove and bring the water to a boil over high heat.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Reduce heat and simmer:\n",
            "   - Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer.\n",
            "   - The simmering time can vary depending on the type of rice, but generally, it takes 15-20 minutes for white rice and 30-40 minutes for brown rice.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Check for doneness:\n",
            "   - After the recommended simmering time, check the rice for doneness. The rice should be tender and the water should be absorbed.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Remove from heat and let it rest:\n",
            "   - Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5-10 minutes. This allows the rice to finish cooking and the grains to become fluffy.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Fluff and serve:\n",
            "   - After the resting period, use a fork or a rice paddle to gently fluff the rice, separating the grains.\n",
